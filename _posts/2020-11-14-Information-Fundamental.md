**Information Literacy** is the process of Information Search and Models.
**Information**: Data that are processed and integrated to be meaningful, like average, maximum, differences, chart.  
**Knowledge**: useful patterns from organized data and
information  
**Wisdom**: evaluate the discovered knowledge and make
recommendation for the future.  

These five steps together is called the information processing cycle
▪ input, process, output, store, and communicate

**Information technologies** can be considered as electronic systems of hardware and software that can capture, digitally process, exchange, store, and/or present data or information.

Take computer as an example, there are many advantages of
using them:
▪ Speed: huge processing speed
▪ Reliability: (quite) reliable hardware and software
▪ Consistency: consistent results
▪ Storage: huge storage capacity and many different media
▪ Communication: easy to be connected

**Big Data**
▪ Volume - organizations collect data from different sources
▪ Velocity: data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a timely manner
▪ Variety: data comes in all types of formats
▪ Variability, data flows can be highly inconsistent with periodic peaks
▪ Complexity, multiple sources difficult to link, match

**Data analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover useful information.
▪ IaaS (or Infrastructure as a Service)
▪ PaaS (or Platform as a Service)
▪ SaaS (or Software as a Service)

**Automation** is any process that is self-driven, reduces, and eventually eliminates, the need for human intervention

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to “learn” from their environment.

An information literate individual should be able to:
▪ determine the extent of information needed
▪ access the needed information effectively and efficiently
▪ evaluate information and its sources critically
▪ incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base
▪ use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose
▪ understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally

**Analog device**
recognizes data as a continuous measurement of a physical property

**Digital device**
works with discrete numbers

capture the analog data and represent them by a series of numbers. The most common method to convert analog data/signal into a digital representation is sampling.

An operating system (OS) is a set of programs containing instructions that work together to coordinate all the activities among computer hardware resources.

 Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)
 Data selection
 Data pre-processing
 Data transformation
 Data mining
 Data modelling and analysis
 Classification – Decision Tree
