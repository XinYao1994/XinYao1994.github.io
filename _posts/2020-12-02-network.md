## Application layer
- frequency division multiplexing: different channels transmitted in different frequency bands
- Circuit switching: used in the legacy telephone networks
   - FDM (frequency) versus TDM (time)
   - bursty, not fully used, Fixed data rate, Connection state maintenance
- Packet switching: used in the Internet
   - chunks packet - header (address, TTL, Checksum) and payload
   - “cut through” switch: start transmit as soon as it has processed the header. 
   - store and forward switch: a switch processes/forwards a packet after it has received it entirely.
   - No link resources are reserved in advance. Instead packet switching leverages statistical multiplexing
       - relies on the assumption that not all flows burst at the same time
       - queue: pipe view
   - packet switching allows more users to use network (1-P(1-10))
   - arriving packets dropped (loss) if no free buffers
      - transmission
      - propagation
      - nodal processing
      - queueing (La/R)
      - Processing, queuing, transmission, propagation
- Interprocess Communication
   - Shared memory
   - Message passing
- TCP (SMTP, Telnet, HTTP, FTP)
   - reliable transport
   - flow control
   - congestion control
   - connection-oriented
- UDP (streaming media, Internet telephony, SIP, RTP)
   - unreliable data transfer
- HTTP: Extra load on the server for managing parallel connections
   - Cache
   - reduce response time for client request
   - reduce traffic on an institution’s access link
   - Internet dense with caches: enables “poor” content providers to effectively deliver content
   - access link rate increase the costs
   - cache hit rate (Conditional GET)
- SMTP (push)
   - persistent connections
   - delivery/storage to receiver’s server
   - view: POP, IMAP, HTTP

      - Local DNS
         - iterated query call diff
         - recursive query call-return
   - resource records
      - (name, value, type, ttl)
      - A(hostname, ip) NS(domain, hostname) ...
   - UDP used for queries
   - DDoS attacks and Redirect attacks
- UDP: no “connection” between client & server
   - no handshaking before sending data: may be lost or received
out-of-order
- TCP: client must contact server
   - Three way handshake

Important:
- Transport Layer
   - Everything covered in lectures is on the exam
   - Sockets (multiplexing/demultiplexing), UDP, Reliable Data Transfer Principles, TCP, Congestion Control
## Transport Layer
- UDP: connectionless transport
   - dest IP address/port number
   - checksum: addition (one’s complement sum) of segment contents
- TCP: connection-oriented reliable transport
   - corrupted, lost, delayed, reordered, deplicated
   - source IP address/port number, dest IP address/port number
   - sender sends one packet, then waits for receiver response
   - checksum to detect bit errors: ACK and NAK
   - sends ACK for last pkt
   - timeout
   - pipe line
   - Go-Back-N (week 4)
      - sender only resends pkts for which ACK not received
   - Selective repeat (out of order)
      - only resend the lost package
- multiplexing at sender
   - handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- demultiplexing at receiver
   - use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket
- EstimatedRTT = (1- a )*EstimatedRTT +  a *SampleRTT
- DevRTT = (1- b)*DevRTT + b *|SampleRTT-EstimatedRTT|
- TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4*DevRTT
- congestion control: too many sources sending too much data too fast for network to handle
   - Increases delays, loss rate, retransmissions
   - end-end congestion control
   - network-assisted congestion control
   - Vary window size to control sending rate: w_size/RTT
       - w_size = min(CWND, RWND)
       - Duplicate ACK and Timeout
       - Slow Start: cwnd = 1, double cwnd, incrementing cwnd
       - AIMD: cut cwnd in half after loss
       - stop Slow-Start and start Additive Increase: slow start threshold
           - CWND = CWND + 1 (>= ssthresh)
           - dupACKcount = 3 (ssthresh = CWND = CWND/2)
           - loss: ssthresh = CWND/2 CWND = 1

- Network Layer
   - Data Plane: everything covered in lectures is on the exam
      - Overview, IP, Addressing, NAT
   - Control Plane: everything covered in lectures is on the exam
      - Overview, link-state routing, distance vector routing, ICMP
## Network Layer
- forwarding: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output
- routing: determine route taken by packets from source to dest.
   - IP Packet
   - Decremented at each hop, packet discarded if reaches 0
   - IP fragmentation
- Subnetting
- Longest prefix match
- NAT - Local network uses just one IP address as far as outside world is concerned
   - violates the architectural model of IP
   - changes the Internet from connection less to a kind of connection-oriented network
   - possibility must be taken into account by app designers
   -  Inbound-NAT (NAT table)
- shortest paths 
- Link State (Global)
   - Routers maintain cost of each link in the network
   - Connectivity/cost changes flooded to all routers
   - Converges quickly (less inconsistency, looping, etc.)
   - Limited network sizes
- Distance Vector (Decentralised)
   - Routers maintain next hop & cost of each destination.
   - Connectivity/cost changes iteratively propagate form neighbour to neighbour
   - Requires multiple rounds to converge
   - Scales to large networks

      - Overview, Error correction detection, multiple access protocols, switched LAN, MAC addressing, ARP, Ethernet, Switches
