- router 
  - interconnect networks
  - protocol conversion
  - routing (determine the output for each incoming data unit)
  - switching (transfer packets from inputs to outpus)
  - other functions 

- IP tries the best to deliver, but cannot guarantee it
- TCP resend to guarantee

?? two additional computer  

- IP address -> global
  - 2^N network + 2^M computers
  - Ch2P12 -> A/B/C
  - 0.0 -> network addrsss
  - 255.255 -> boardcase address
  - 20 byte IP header
  - version of IP
  - length
  - ID number
  - source/des IP address
- MAC address (48 bit) -> locally
  - maxumum packet size, MTU (1500/2272)
  - split long msg
  - length, offset (8 bytes), more fragment flag - 1 if any

- port number (16 bits)
- seq number (32 bits)
- 3-way handshaking

- re-sequences based on the seq number.
