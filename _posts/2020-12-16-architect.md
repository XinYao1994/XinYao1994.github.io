- RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory. Random access means that memory contents can be accessed directly if you know its location.
- Cache is a type of temporary memory that can be accessed faster than RAM.
- SATA, hard disk interfaces with other system components.
   - Serial ports send data as a series of pulses along one or two data lines.
   - Parallel ports send data as a single pulse along at least eight data lines.
- Booth’s algorithm

- sum-of-products
- product-of-sums
- Kmap

- In little endian machines, the least significant byte is followed by the most significant byte.
- Big endian machines store the most significant byte first (at the lower address). 
- Stack arithmetic requires that we use postfix notation: Z = XY+.

- k*2^(m)

- Temporal locality: Recently-accessed data elements tend to be accessed again.
- Spatial locality: Accesses tend to cluster.
- Sequential locality: Instructions tend to be accessed sequentially.

- In a direct mapped cache consisting of N blocks of cache, block X of main memory maps to cache block Y = X mod N.Thus, if we have 10 blocks of cache, block 7 of cache may hold blocks 7, 17, 27, 37, . . . of main memory.

- Set associative cache combines the ideas of direct mapped cache and fully associative cache 
- tag, set, and offset
- the accesses overlap: EAT = H * AccessC + (1 – H) * AccessMM
- the accesses non-overlap: EAT = H * AccessC + (1 – H) * (AccessMM+AccessC)

- Write through and Write back 


- S = 1/(1-f)+(f/k)
- Price/precentage

- This is a DMA configuration. 
- Notice that the DMA and the CPU share the bus.  
- The DMA runs at a higher priority and steals memory cycles from the CPU.
- Cycle Stealing is a method of accessing computer memory or bus without interfering with the CPU. It is similar to direct memory access for allowing I/O controllers to read or write RAM without CPU intervention.


- Hard disk platters are mounted on spindles.
- Read/write heads are mounted on a comb that swings radially to read the disk.
- he rotating disk forms a logical cylinder beneath the read/write heads.
- Data blocks are addressed by their cylinder, surface, and sector.

- Seek time is the time that it takes for a disk arm to move into position over the desired cylinder.
- Rotational delay is the time that it takes for the desired sector to move into position beneath the read/write head.
- Seek time + rotational delay = access time.
   - (60000/rotation speed)/2
- Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) 

- Redundant Array of Independent Disks
